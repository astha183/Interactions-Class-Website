    <p class="subheading"> Garden of Forking Paths <p>
    <p> The excerpt from “Garden of Forking Paths” is interesting, especially due to the fact that it has two missing pages at the beginning, which makes the reader delve into the narrative headfirst. One of the first aspects about this piece of writing that stood out to me is the descriptive writing style fitting of being read over by an English teacher. It also has an interesting narrative style to it, with a storylike effect, through sentences like “I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning,” and “he does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.” The title “Garden of Forking Paths” is also an important metaphor that is shown through the entire text through the metaphors and imagery that involve mazes and labyrinths. </p>
        
    <p class="subheading"> Basic HTML Competency Is the New Punk Folk Explosion!</p>
        <p> This article offers an interesting perespective on the punk idea of homemade html websites.

The era of making smaller websites like the ones described in the article may have passed, but the idea of treating them like art projects and part of movements is important. It is an aspect of online presence that while somewhat dying gives one a large degree of freedom.</p>
    
        <p class="subheading">The Concept of a Meta-Font</p>   
    <p>The concept of a meta-font presented in the research paper is certainly an interesting and innovative idea. The ability to adapt the appearance of a font based on the context in which it is used has the potential to greatly enhance the way that text is presented and understood. The article explores many different aspects of this research idea. It also has many visual examples of different fonts and the way they are represented. This research paper explores an interesting aspect of communication, shown through clear arguments and statements such as "A font should be sublime in its appearance but subliminal in its effect. All of these statements are emphasised by statements such as "How does something become a folk tradition? Is it the age of the practice, or how many (or few) people practice it? </p>
        
        <p class=subheading>What is Code?</p>
        
    <p>"What is Code" is an interesting and lighthearted explanation of code that provides a very broad perspective on what coding can mean, to a general audience. The article also touches on topics such as algorithms, data structures, and debugging, and includes interactive elements such as quizzes and exercises. One of the prominent aspects of this article is its visual style: it is against a very colourful backdrop and also contains many different types of imagery. Through sentences using second person and extended metaphors such as "On the other side of your (well-organized) desk sits this guy in his mid-30s with a computer in his lap. He’s wearing a taupe blazer," the article is made much more engaging. </p>
