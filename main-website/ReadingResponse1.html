    <h1> Week 1/Garden of Forking Paths </h1>
    <p> The excerpt from “Garden of Forking Paths” is interesting, especially due to the fact that it has two missing pages at the beginning, which makes the reader delve into the narrative headfirst. One of the first aspects about this piece of writing that stood out to me is the descriptive writing style fitting of being read over by an English teacher. Sentences such as “the never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky,” effectively create an engaging atmosphere. It also has an interesting narrative style to it, with a storylike effect, through sentences like “I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning,” and “he does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.” The title “Garden of Forking Paths” is also an important metaphor that is shown through the entire text through the metaphors and imagery that involve mazes and labyrinths. </p>
